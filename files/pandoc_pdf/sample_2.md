By default, `background` is set to `null`.

Can be changed to different color to suit the chosen theme.

```python
# sample comment: a/b != a\b

>>> 2 ** 5
32
```

Executing Python program from shell:

```bash
$ python3.7 list_looping.py
numbers:      [2, 12, 3, 25, 624, 21, 5, 9, 12]
odd_numbers:  [3, 25, 21, 5, 9]
even_numbers: [2, 12, 624, 12]
```

Just another line.
